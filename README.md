# trout-web

A web version of [trout](https://github.com/Osrepnay/trout).
Uses the WASM backend of GHC.
The UI uses [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) for rendering and [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for chess rules.

If you want to build it - why would you want to build it? - use the build.sh script. Check the github workflow files for dependencies and such
